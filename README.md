# Demo Angular RxJS Concepts App
This demo app was created specifically to explain and explore RxJS concepts in Angular. It does not have complex features; its main purpose is to serve as a learning tool for understanding how RxJS integrates with Angular.

---

## Features
Demonstrates conversion between signals and observables

Shows how to convert observables back to signals and Vice-versa

Implements a custom observable

Explains and utilizes core observable concepts

Uses the .pipe() method and common RxJS operators

---

## Concepts Illustrated
Signal to Observable
Convert a reactive signal (Angular state) into an RxJS observable so it can be used with the entire RxJS ecosystem.

Observable to Signal
Take any RxJS observable and convert it into a signal for seamless integration with Angular's signal-based reactivity.

Custom Observable Creation
Learn to define your own observables using the Observable constructor or creation operators (like of, from, etc.).

RxJS Operators and Pipe
See the .pipe() pattern and use operators such as map, filter, take, and catchError to transform and control observable streams.

---

## Usage
Study the code to understand how to create and subscribe to observables

Learn how to manage, compose, and transform streams of data using RxJS operators

Review the signal-to-observable and observable-to-signal conversion patterns for advanced Angular projects

---

## Why This Demo?
This project is for learning purposes only—ideal for Angular beginners and those new to RxJS. It is designed to show how to connect Angular’s new signal state system with reactive streams and the broader RxJS toolkit.
